#  My Automation Portfolio (n8n + AI)

Welcome to my collection of **automation workflows** built using **n8n**, **AI models**, and other tools.  
These workflows show how I experiment with **local AI hosting, bots, and productivity automations** â€” all cost-free and self-contained.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. AI Playground Chatbot

- **Tools:** n8n + LM Studio + Mistral-7B  
- **Description:** Connects n8n to a local AI model (Mistral-7B Instruct) running in LM Studio.  
- **How it works:**  
  1. A Set node stores the user prompt.  
  2. An HTTP Request sends the prompt to `http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions`.  
  3. The response is captured back into n8n.  

- **Features:**  
  - Fully offline, no API costs.  
  - Custom headers + JSON body integration.  
  - Can be extended into bots (Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp).  

- **Download Workflow:**

## ðŸ”¹ 2. (Coming Soon) Finance Tracker Bot

- **Tools:** n8n + WhatsApp API + Google Sheets

- **Status:** In progress.

## ðŸ”¹ More Projects Coming Soonâ€¦
- Messaging bots  
- Research agents  
- Creative automation tools

### âš¡ Why this matters
By hosting AI locally and connecting it with n8n, I can:  
- Build **autonomous AI agents** step by step.  
- Automate tasks without depending on paid API keys.  
- Share workflows as templates for anyone to try.

### ðŸ“‚ How to Use
1. Clone/download this repo.  
2. Import the JSON into your local n8n instance.  
3. Adjust nodes as needed (model name, prompts, or integrations).

ðŸ’¡ **Follow my journey:** Iâ€™ll keep adding workflows here as I expand into bots, research assistants, and more.
